# list-all-files-
This script will create a file.csv with all the files and folders of the given root-folder of your collection

The purpose of this script is to generate a tabular list of all your files on the selected path where your document collection can be found. In addition to the usual attributes such as path, file name, size, extension and file date, a fingerprint (hash code) is calculated for the file.

It then serves the project compare-n-share (see in the separate repository) as an input file for the exchange of documents between friends who collect documents on the same topic. Finally, files in large collections can be found and exchanged automatically without having to go through the collection file by file.
